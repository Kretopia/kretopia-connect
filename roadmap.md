# Roadmap

## Landing Match video and scroll navigation
- [x] Preserve native 1440×1800 Match master; lossless fast-start optimization and CDN delivery (HTTP 206 verified).
- [x] Replace scroll dots with theme-aware vertical marks that expand for the active chapter.
- [x] Verify navigation visually, active Match → Studio, targeted test and lossless video decode/hash.
- [ ] Confirm browser playback on a real device — sandbox Chromium lacks H.264 decoding; native source and optimized copy decode successfully with FFmpeg.

## Company mode overhaul
- [x] Synchronize account switching and Company navigation across pages.
- [x] Align Studios, Gigs, Talent and Pay with shared headers and Wrapped surfaces, preserving Creator Studio.
- [x] Add Company signals and complete Menu access.
- [x] Verify targeted tests (23 passing) and public preview; leave production backend and domains unchanged.
- [ ] Verify authenticated Company switching and live hiring/payment flows — blocked: no mintable preview account and legacy authentication unavailable to managed session tooling.

- [x] Simplify Landing chapters and preview cards; align chapter numbering, logo-colored scroll markers, and smooth anchor scrolling

- [ ] Overhaul Today into profile-driven creator intelligence
- [ ] Replace Live and Passport readiness with miniature Holo Passport
- [ ] Integrate Kreto Robot guidance and Kreto Computer floating image
- [ ] Apply explicit CPO document principles without inventing requirements
- [ ] Validate tests and responsive presentation
