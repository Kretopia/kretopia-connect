/**
 * KretopiaHero — Section 1 of the Kretopia landing page.
 *
 * Copy locked per GTM review: leads with the immediate desire (find work
 * that fits what you do) before the mechanism (Creative Passport), states
 * the Passport in plain English instead of assuming it's understood, and
 * surfaces Scout in the hero since it's now a primary reason to build a
 * Passport in the first place. Two CTAs of equal weight: build the
 * Passport, or go straight to what it unlocks (Scout). No third action
 * competing with them -- the real "claim your record by searching your
 * name" flow this hero used to front-end is reachable through the site's
 * persistent navbar search (now shown on the landing page too, see
 * Navbar.tsx), not duplicated here.
 *
 * Background: "Verified Creative Signal Field" -- replaces an earlier
 * multicolor aurora that, per direct feedback and a read-only audit
 * (LANDING_HERO_SIGNAL_FIELD_AUDIT.md), mixed five hues (including green,
 * reserved for KrePay) and directly contradicted a house rule already
 * encoded in index.css: the old multi-color "Signal Triad" tokens
 * (--signal-pink/amber/violet/teal) were deliberately retired down to one
 * dominant accent (--energy). This field is built around that one accent
 * plus --secondary (the same grey used in .btn-landing-primary's own
 * gradient) -- one restrained grey-to-pink field, a few decorative proof
 * nodes, and the official KretoMark at low opacity. Text first, CTA
 * second, field always subordinate to both.
