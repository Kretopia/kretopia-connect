/**
 * CinematicHeaderPlate — the shared render core behind FeaturePageHeader and
 * EditorialPageHero. Both components wrap this with their own outer element
 * and backdrop layers (aurora/grid/grain) and pass through their own extras
 * (tutorial trigger, tabs, children) via `cornerSlot`/`footer` — but the
 * eyebrow pill, title, subtitle and reveal motion render from exactly one
 * place now, instead of being duplicated between the two files. See
 * TITLE_ANIMATION_AUDIT.md for why this split existed and was normalized:
 * the two components previously had identical motion timing but diverging
 * container width (1024px vs 1100px) and vertical padding.
