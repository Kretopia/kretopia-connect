/**
 * KretoCharacter — Kretopia's real, owned 3D character render of Kreto.
 * Confirmed team-owned asset (not a third-party reference) -- see
 * KRETO_CHARACTER_ASSET_REPORT.md. Five cropped stills from the source
 * "Meet Kreto" artwork: the main character plus four role variants
 * (Scout, Connector, Producer, Publicist).
 *
 * This is a small number of static photographic poses, not a rigged 3D
 * model -- there is exactly one pose per variant, so this component
 * cannot express different facial expressions per app state the way the
 * abstract KretoPresence can. State is instead layered on top as a small
 * signal-dot badge (same accent-dot language as KretoPresence, same
 * honesty rule: only render a non-idle badge when something real is
 * happening) plus the same paired sr-only text announcement -- state is
 * still never color/motion alone.
 *
 * "main" uses a real alpha-channel cutout (background removed via
 * ML segmentation, not a CSS fade) -- direct feedback flagged the
 * earlier CSS radial-mask approach as still reading like "a pasted
 * image with a visible box", which is real: a soft edge fade can
 * never fully hide a rectangular source photo's corners. A true cutout
 * has no box to hide in the first place. The source photo's own ground
 * shadow was removed by the segmentation along with the rest of the
 * background (it wasn't part of the character's solid silhouette) --
 * a separate, deliberate CSS radial-gradient "grounding" ellipse
 * beneath the character replaces it, giving the same "standing on
 * something" feel without depending on a baked-in shadow that only
 * ever looked right against one exact background. The four role
 * variants still render inside a rounded-square tile, matching their
 * own presentation in the source artwork -- a defined edge is correct
 * there, not a flaw to hide.
 *
 * `hoverable` makes the cast feel alive to a real pointer, per direct
 * feedback ("comme des ballons... flotter dans l'air"): idle motion
 * drifts on both axes like a buoyant balloon, and a real hover knocks
 * the character to a random nearby spot with a springy, elastic
 * transition, settling back into its own drift once the pointer
 * leaves -- off by default everywhere else.
